# Project Title

Online Marketplace

## Project Description

C# application which aims to design an online marketplace. The application has three types of users: the buyer, the salesman and the administrator of the platform. All of them have to provide a username and a password in order to use the application.

This kind of online marketplace is based on announcements. A salesman posts an announcement of whatever he has to sell and then waits for a message from a possible buyer. The buyer can search through a wide collection of items ( furniture, bikes, clothes, electronics etc.) and then add the items that (s)he likes into a wishlist.

The salesman can perform the following operations:
* CRUD on announcements
* Receive messages from the buyer and then chat

The user can perform the following operations:
* Send messages to the seller

The administrator can perform the following operations:
* Give restriction to the salesman's announcements
* Give recommandations to the buyer based on his/her wishlist
